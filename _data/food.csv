CANADIAN CHEESE,,,,
Castello® Smoked Gorgonzola,"Castello® Smoked Gorgonzola embodies the classical “Blue Bite” and piquant flavour of blue cheese, with a slightly saltier taste and firmer texture. The smoking smooths out the “Blue Bite” and balances the flavours for a distinct eating experience. Naturally double smoked with a selection of hardwoods including Applewood. The rich, smoky flavour is ideal for a pizza or burger topping and as a kick to a green salad or vegetable dish (i.e. crumbled on green beans).
For a cheeseboard, Smoked Gorgonzola can be included as the final, strong cheese in an assortment working from mild to bold. Serve with a rustic bread or cracker.",,,
Tre Stelle® Bocconcini ,"These little balls of fresh mozzarella are made with 100% milk and have a firm but yielding texture. Bocconcini plays an important supporting role in salads, soups, appetizers, sandwiches, pizzas and more. Tre Stelle® adds versatility with ‘mini mini,’ ‘Pearls’ and light variations. Try the ultra-convenient pre-sliced Bocconcini Medallions, ready to melt on a pizza, supplement a sandwich or elevate a salad.",,,
Castello® Double Crème Canadian Brie ,"Castello® Double Crème Brie Cheese is a classic soft cheese with a creamy, velvety texture, buttery taste and slight ammonia aroma. Its interior is off-white, a distinct contrast to the white bloomy exterior. Made in Canada with 100% milk, the name Brie is actually for the region in France where this cheese type originated. A must have for any cheese platter, this almost spreadable cheese is also versatile enough to be used in many recipes ranging from appetizers to entrees and desserts.",,,
CASTELLO® Jalapeno,"Castello® Jalapeño Havarti Cheese is made with mild red and green jalapeños for a gentle hint of spice that develops more character as it matures. The easy-to-slice Havarti cheese has a soft and creamy consistency, allowing for simple enjoyment. The bold and buttery notes indulgently blend in your mouth while the creamy texture melts bite after bite.",,,
CASTELLO® Dill Havarti,"This Temptingly Tangy Dill Havarti Cheese is made with subtle dill infusions, for a gentle hint of incredible freshness that develops more character as it matures. The easy-to-slice Havarti cheese has a soft and creamy consistency, which makes it easy to enjoy. Let the bold and buttery notes indulgently blend in your mouth as the creamy texture almost melts, bite after bite. ",,,
Tre Stelle® Smoked Havarti,"Castello® Smoked Havarti Slices has a wonderfully smooth and buttery texture with a mild yet satisfyingly full flavour of ""smoky"" and nutty. It is strictly following traditional Havarti methods with Castello craftmanship. Typically aged for 1 month, to keep it relatively young and soft",,,
,,,,
DANISH CHEESE,,,,
Castello® Danish Blue,"From mild to bold there's a Castello® Blue right for you. Award-winning specialty Blue cheese covering a broad taste spectrum, from extra creamy Danish Blue to traditional aromatic Danish Blue; there is a cheese for every palate. All Castello® Blue cheese is made with traditional methods and has won numerous awards, including the prestigious title of 'World's Best Cheese'.",,,
Castello® Aged Havarti,"A 12-month maturation gives this Havarti time to develop its rich, creamy texture and fine flavor crystals for a true taste experience in every bite; the perfect addition to a cheeseboard! Rich, creamy flavor with notes of butter and caramel.  ",,,
Castello® Fontina,"Castello® Fontina is a mild, pale yellow, creamy cow’s milk cheese from Denmark. It is a semi-soft cheese with a creamy texture. It has a mellow, sweet, aromatic and distinguished delicate, buttery flavor. Sliceable and suitable for shredding; it’s a great substitute for Mozzarella Cheese. Serve Danish Fontina with fruits and crusty breads. Excellent for melting in fondues or sauces. It melts well in the oven without any oil residue.",,,
,,,,
ENGLISH CHEESE,,,,
Castello® TICKLER™ Extra Mature Cheddar Cheese,"With its wide complexity of flavour, this extra mature cheddar cheese will pleasantly surprise you. First you will notice the crunch, as salty crystals pop on your tongue. Then the punch, as tangy aromas storm your taste buds. Utterly satisfying, as you’d expect from a Gold Medal Winner at the 2015 British Cheese Awards. Castello Extra Mature Cheddar is great as an indulgent snack on its own but is a sharp companion to other cheeses as part of a cheese board.",,,
,,,,
ITALIAN CHEESE,,,,
Grana Padano,"Only Grana Padano’s qualities entitle it to the name Grana Padano. It is for this reason its name must always be said in its entirety: Grana Padano.
The highly esteemed table or grating cheese from the Po valley in Italy, is famous all over the world. It is the perfect enhancement to Mediterranean dishes, accompanied by white wines or semi-sparkling reds. It is used for all courses, from appetizers to desserts: as an aperitif, with ""carpaccio"", on salads or accompanied by fruit and vegetables. It is high in calcium and phosphorous and is easily digestible – the perfect cheese for today’s busy lifestyle.
",,,
Piave,"Piave is a pasteurized cow's milk cheese named after a river by the same name. It is DOP (protected designation of origin), and the only authentic Piave is produced in the Dolomites area of Belluno province of Veneto and is also called Parmesan's Cousin due to apparent similarities in flavour. Piave Mezzano (blue label) is aged for 61 to 180 days. The aroma of yoghurt and milk is evocative with a delicate, pleasant flavour. The soft paste of the cheese is ivory white in colour while the rind is soft and light.",,,
,,,,
SWISS CHEESE,,,,
Appenzeller,"The raw, robust milk that goes into Appenzeller comes from cows that graze in the lush meadows of Appenzeller, Switzerland. Cheesemakers wash each wheel with a secret herbal brine infused with wine, cider and a mixture of herbs, blossoms and other natural ingredients. All of which adds a complex flavor that connoisseurs desire. 
Similar in texture to other traditional ""Swiss cheese"" - firm, pliable and with holes – Appenzeller has a nutty flavor combined with an herbal spiciness, suggesting ginger, black tea and clover. Good for melting, feel free to substitute in a fondue.
",,,
Le Gruyere ,"Le Gruyère has been crafted since the 12th century using the same recipe. Today more than 160 creameries in small villages throughout a designated area in Switzerland (the cantons of Fribourg, Neufchatel and Vaud) carry on this same tradition. 
The cheese is crafted exclusively in copper vats to impart a unique, complex character that connoisseurs crave. As Le Gruyére AOP slowly aged a minimum of 5 months in the cave-like atmosphere of Emmi cellars, each wheel is delicately turned, lightly brined and brushed. This brings out an inimitable flavor featuring notes of candied walnuts, dried fruit and spice that is perfect for cheeseboards and cooking. Gruyere is renowned for its sweet flavor with hint of nuttiness, and a texture that is firm and pliable, and excellent for melting and grilling, especially fabulous in fondues and incredible in French-Onion soups. Pair it with a big, full-bodied, sweet red Beaujolais.
