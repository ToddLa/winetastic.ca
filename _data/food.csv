CANADIAN CHEESE,,,,
Castello® Smoked Gorgonzola,"Castello® Smoked Gorgonzola embodies the classical “Blue Bite” and piquant flavour of blue cheese, with a slightly saltier taste and firmer texture. The smoking smooths out the “Blue Bite” and balances the flavours for a distinct eating experience. Naturally double smoked with a selection of hardwoods including Applewood. The rich, smoky flavour is ideal for a pizza or burger topping and as a kick to a green salad or vegetable dish (i.e. crumbled on green beans).

ITALIAN CHEESE,,,,
Grana Padano,"Only Grana Padano’s qualities entitle it to the name Grana Padano. It is for this reason its name must always be said in its entirety: Grana Padano. 
The highly esteemed table or grating cheese from the Po valley in Italy, is famous all over the world. It is the perfect enhancement to Mediterranean dishes, accompanied by white wines or semi-sparkling reds. It is used for all courses, from appetizers to desserts: as an aperitif, with ""carpaccio"", on salads or accompanied by fruit and vegetables. It is high in calcium and phosphorous and is easily digestible – the perfect cheese for today’s busy lifestyle.",,,
Piave,"Piave is a pasteurized cow's milk cheese named after a river by the same name. It is DOP (protected designation of origin), and the only authentic Piave is produced in the Dolomites area of Belluno province of Veneto and is also called Parmesan's Cousin due to apparent similarities in flavour. Piave Mezzano (blue label) is aged for 61 to 180 days. The aroma of yoghurt and milk is evocative with a delicate, pleasant flavour. The soft paste of the cheese is ivory white in colour while the rind is soft and light.",,,
Asiago,"Asiago DOP (protected designation of origin) is a cow's milk cheese produced only on the Asiago plateau in the Veneto foothills in Italy. The cheese-making tradition in the provinces of Vicenza and Trento dates back more than a thousand years. Traditionally, it was made from sheep's milk, but today it is produced from unpasteurised cow's milk. 
Fresh Asiago (Pressato) is a semi-soft cheese with large but irregular shaped holes. It has a thin and elastic crust with soft, buttery, white-yellowish paste. It tastes sweet, buttery, delicate and tangy and has a slightly, salty aftertaste. The taste is reminiscent of cream and fresh milk. The fresh Asiago cheese goes well with sandwiches and salads as it is easily cut, cubed, sliced or melted.",,,
SWITZERLAND CHEESE,,,,
Appenzeller,"The raw, robust milk that goes into Appenzeller comes from cows that graze in the lush meadows of Appenzeller, Switzerland. Cheesemakers wash each wheel with a secret herbal brine infused with wine, cider and a mixture of herbs, blossoms and other natural ingredients. All of which adds a complex flavor that connoisseurs desire. 
Similar in texture to other traditional ""Swiss cheese"" - firm, pliable and with holes – Appenzeller has a nutty flavor combined with an herbal spiciness, suggesting ginger, black tea and clover. Good for melting, feel free to substitute in a fondue.",,,
Le Gruyere,"Le Gruyère has been crafted since the 12th century using the same recipe. Today more than 160 creameries in small villages throughout a designated area in Switzerland (the cantons of Fribourg, Neufchatel and Vaud) carry on this same tradition. 
The cheese is crafted exclusively in copper vats to impart a unique, complex character that connoisseurs crave. As Le Gruyére AOP slowly aged a minimum of 5 months in the cave-like atmosphere of Emmi cellars, each wheel is delicately turned, lightly brined and brushed. This brings out an inimitable flavor featuring notes of candied walnuts, dried fruit and spice that is perfect for cheeseboards and cooking. Gruyere is renowned for its sweet flavor with hint of nuttiness, and a texture that is firm and pliable, and excellent for melting and grilling, especially fabulous in fondues and incredible in French-Onion soups. Pair it with a big, full-bodied, sweet red Beaujolais.",,,
