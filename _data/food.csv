Le Gruyere®," Le Gruyère has been crafted since the 12th century using the same recipe. Today more than 160 creameries in small villages throughout a designated area in Switzerland (the cantons of Fribourg, Neufchatel and Vaud) carry on this same tradition. 
The cheese is crafted exclusively in copper vats to impart a unique, complex character that connoisseurs crave. As Le Gruyére AOP slowly aged a minimum of 5 months in the cave-like atmosphere of Emmi cellars, each wheel is delicately turned, lightly brined and brushed. This brings out an inimitable flavor featuring notes of candied walnuts, dried fruit and spice that is perfect for cheeseboards and cooking. Gruyere is renowned for its sweet flavor with hint of nuttiness, and a texture that is firm and pliable, and excellent for melting and grilling, especially fabulous in fondues and incredible in French-Onion soups. Pair it with a big, full-bodied, sweet red Beaujolais.
